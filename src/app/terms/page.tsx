          <p>Please read these Terms of Service ("Terms", "Terms of Service") carefully before using the ConvertIQ website (the "Service") operated by us.</p>
          
          <p>Your access to and use of the Service is conditioned on your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms. These Terms apply to all visitors, users, and others who access or use the Service. By accessing or using the Service you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree with any part of the terms, then you may not access the Service.</p>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2 text-foreground">1. Use of Services</h2>
              <p>You agree to use our services for lawful purposes only. You are prohibited from using the Service:</p>
              <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 mt-2 pl-4">
                  <li>To upload, convert, or generate any content that is illegal, harmful, threatening, abusive, harassing, defamatory, vulgar, obscene, or otherwise objectionable.</li>
                  <li>To infringe on any patent, trademark, trade secret, copyright, or other proprietary rights of any party. You must have the legal right to use any file you upload.</li>
                  <li>To transmit any material that contains software viruses or any other computer code, files, or programs designed to interrupt, destroy, or limit the functionality of any computer software or hardware.</li>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2 text-foreground">2. File Handling and Privacy</h2>
              <p>We prioritize your privacy. As detailed in our <Link href="/privacy" className="text-primary hover:underline">Privacy Policy</Link>, most file processing is done client-side. For features that require server-side processing, uploaded files are automatically deleted from our servers within a few hours. We do not access, view, or share your files.</p>
          </div>
          
          <div>
              <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2 text-foreground">3. AI-Powered and Demonstration Tools</h2>
              <p>Some of our tools (e.g., Background Remover, SEO tools) are powered by generative artificial intelligence. While we strive for accuracy, the output from these tools is generated by an AI and may not always be perfect or accurate. You are responsible for reviewing and verifying the results.</p>
              <p className="mt-2">Additionally, certain converters are provided as demonstrations (e.g., PDF to Word, GIF to MP4). These tools simulate the conversion process and do not produce a fully functional output file. They are intended to showcase upcoming functionality.</p>

          <div>
              <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2 text-foreground">4. Intellectual Property</h2>
              <p>The Service and its original content (excluding content provided by users), features, and functionality are and will remain the exclusive property of ConvertIQ and its licensors. Our trademarks may not be used in connection with any product or service without our prior written consent.</p>

          <div>
              <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2 text-foreground">5. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
              <p>The Service is provided on an "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" basis. ConvertIQ makes no warranties, expressed or implied, and hereby disclaims and negates all other warranties including, without limitation, implied warranties or conditions of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement of intellectual property or other violation of rights.
